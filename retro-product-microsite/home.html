      The Dreamcast is remembered for being ahead of its time, with several concepts that became standard
      in consoles, such as motion controls and online functionality. Its demise has been connected with transitions
      in the video game industry. In 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Duncan Harris wrote that the
      Dreamcast's end "signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture ... Sega's console gave hope that things were not
      about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to
      sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games."[343] Parish contrasted the Dreamcast's diverse library
      with the "suffocating sense of conservatism" that pervaded the industry in the following decade.

      In 1969, Sega was sold to the American conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries, although Rosen remained CEO. In
      1974, Gulf and Western made Sega Enterprises, Ltd., a subsidiary of an American company renamed Sega Enterprises,
      Inc. Sega released Pong-Tron, its first video-based game, in 1973.[19] Despite late competition from Taito's hit
      arcade game Space Invaders in 1978, Sega prospered from the arcade video game boom of the late 1970s, with
      revenues climbing to over US$100 million by 1979. During this period, Sega acquired Gremlin Industries, which
      manufactured microprocessor-based arcade games, and Esco Boueki, a coin-op distributor founded and owned by
      Hayao Nakayama. Nakayama was placed in a management role of Sega's Japanese operations. In the early 1980s,
      Sega was one of the top five arcade game manufacturers active in the United States, as company revenues rose to
      $214 million. 1979 saw the release of Head On, which introduced the "eat-the-dots" gameplay Namco later used
      in Pac-Man. In 1981, Sega licensed Frogger, its most successful game until then. In 1982, Sega introduced
      the first game with isometric graphics, Zaxxon
